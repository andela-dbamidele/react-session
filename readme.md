## A simple react app.

### Installation

To get started with the application, you'll need to install the applications dependency after cloning with the command `npm install`.
Then you'll need two working instances of the application:
- one for webpack which is spunned up with `npm run watch`
- the other for spinning up the express sevrer: `npm run start:dev`

Once this is done, you can view the application via `localhost:4000` or the port setup in your `.env` file.
